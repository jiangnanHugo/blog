The equations of the momentum method

$$v(t)=\alpha v(t-1) -\varepsilon \frac{\partial E}{\partial w} (t)$$

The effect of the gradient is to increment the previous velocity. The velocity also decays by $\alpha$ which is slight less than 1.

$$\Delta w(t) = v(t)  = \alpha v(t-1) -\varepsilon \frac{\partial E}{\partial w} (t) = \alpha \Delta w(t-1) -\varepsilon \frac{\partial E}{\partial w} (t)$$

The weight change is equal to the current velocity.

The weight change ca be expressed in terms of the previous weight change and the current gradient.
