I"X<p>The equations of the momentum method:</p>

\[v(t)=\alpha v(t-1) -\varepsilon \frac{\partial E}{\partial w} (t)\]

<p>The effect of the gradient is to increment the previous velocity. The velocity also decays by \(\alpha\) which is slight less than 1.</p>

\[\Delta w(t) = v(t)  = \alpha v(t-1) -\varepsilon \frac{\partial E}{\partial w} (t) = \alpha \Delta w(t-1) -\varepsilon \frac{\partial E}{\partial w} (t)\]

<p>The weight change is equal to the current velocity.</p>

<p>The weight change can be expressed in terms of the previous weight change and the current gradient.</p>
